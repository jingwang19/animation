  <h1>Imagine there's no heaven</h1>

      <p>It's easy if you try
        No hell below us
        Above us only sky

        Imagine all the people
        Living for today (ah ah ah)

        Imagine there's no countries
        It isn't hard to do
        Nothing to kill or die for
        And no religion, too

        Imagine all the people
        Living life in peace

        You may say that I'm a dreamer
        But I'm not the only one
        I hope someday you'll join us
        And the world will be as one

        Imagine no possessions
        I wonder if you can
        No need for greed or hunger
        A brotherhood of man

        Imagine all the people
        Sharing all the world

        You may say that I'm a dreamer
        But I'm not the only one
        I hope someday you'll join us
        And the world will live as one.
